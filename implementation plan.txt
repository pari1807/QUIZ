Overview
Building a comprehensive MERN stack educational platform with advanced admin features and engaging user experience. The platform will support role-based access control, real-time collaboration, gamification, and powerful analytics.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Technology Stack Confirmation

Backend: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
Frontend: React (with Vite) + TailwindCSS
Real-time: Socket.io
File Storage: AWS S3 / Cloudinary (Please specify preference)
AI Features: OpenAI API for summary generation (requires API key)
Cache: Redis for performance optimization
Please confirm or suggest alternatives for:

Cloud Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudinary?
AI Integration: Should we include AI summary generation (requires OpenAI API key)?
Plagiarism Check: External API or basic similarity checking?
WARNING

Development Approach This is a large-scale application. We'll build it in phases:

Phase 1: Core infrastructure + Basic Admin/User features
Phase 2: Advanced features (Analytics, Whiteboard, Gamification)
Should we proceed with Phase 1 first, or do you want the complete implementation?
