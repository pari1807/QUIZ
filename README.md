### challanges Faced

1. Understanding Git Workflow

Initially, it was challenging to clearly understand the difference between working directory, staging area, and commits. With regular practice using git status, git add, and git commit, the workflow became clearer.

2. Managing Multiple Branches

Working with multiple branches such as feature, test, bugfix, and experiment required careful tracking. Switching branches and ensuring the correct branch was active before committing was a common challenge.

3. Merge Conflicts Resolution

Creating and resolving a merge conflict was one of the most important learning experiences. When the same file was modified in different branches, Git produced conflict markers. Understanding these markers and resolving them manually helped in learning real-world collaboration scenarios.

4. Writing Meaningful Commit Messages

Initially, commits were made without much structure. Later, focus was shifted towards writing clear and meaningful commit messages to properly reflect the changes made in each commit.

5. Synchronizing Local and Remote Repositories

At times, pushing changes to GitHub required understanding upstream branches and resolving mismatches between local and remote branches using git pull and proper merge strategies.

6. Maintaining Clean Repository Structure

As the project grew, keeping the repository organized and avoiding unnecessary files was challenging. This was handled by following naming conventions and a clean project structure.

7. Documentation Using Markdown

Writing a professional README.md using Markdown syntax required learning proper headings, code blocks, and formatting to clearly explain the project and Git operations.
